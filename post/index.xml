      <description>Establish a baseline for disc detection.
 Data Calculation of HoGs using varying number of cells and bins Clustering Evaluation Conclusion  Overview Data Source 3471 images, excerpted from 2015bsVriot.mp4, roughly 1 frame per second for about 1 hour.
 Data Preparation Partition the labeled data into two sets: Some portion of the data for training and the rest for testing. For example: 40% training
cd /Users/Karl/Dropbox/Projects/Video-Captioning sh ./partition_data_two_class.sh disc labeled_3471.</description>

      <description>What tools would make the video captioning task easier? What partial solutions contribute to the whole solution? Since the field, the disc, and the players are the key ingredients for a game, tools focused on detecting these items would be a reasonable place to start.
 Identify images depicting the disc. The disc is particularly hard to find, due to its small size; therefore only detected when white patch exceeds a certain size and white patch is roughly circular (and not a picture of a disk on a sign or banner)</description>

      <description>This post explores related work in the areas of object and action detection, selection of an appropriate level of detail, and coherent, multi-sentence description.
The sport of ultimate resembles soccer in some ways. For example, both sports revolve around groups of similarly-clad individuals running around a mostly green environment, focused on a small, fast-moving object. Efforts to understand Soccer present many promising ideas for understanding ultimate.
The single image at the top of this post illustrates an action by itself: A player leaps into the air, attempting to catch the disc.</description>

      <description>How can we choose the best 150 two-second plays from 10 or more hours of raw video? Preparing a highlights video from raw footage is an intensely time-consuming endeavor. This post begins with a brief introduction to the sport of Ultimate, followed by an overview of the temporal structure of a game and temporal structure of scoring a single point. The data inventory describes various sources of information about the game and the post concludes with a glossary and a short list of simplifying assumptions.</description>
