      <description>At the beginning of a new machine learning project, it&#39;s a good idea to create a baseline model that functions end-to-end, even if the performance is not very good. Soon enough, you will think of ideas for better models, and want to try them, evaluate their performance, and maybe keep them for future use in a production environment. What remains constant, over the lifetime of such a project, is that data presented to the pipeline inlet are processed according to a particular recipe, which generates some useful output.</description>

      <title>Photogrammetric Potsherd Profile</title>

      <description>The General Idea Make photogrammetry readily accessible to archaeologists through open source computational archaeology.
More Specifically This project describes in some detail the steps to photograph a potsherd and generate a mathematical model from the resulting images, and, in much less detail, suggests how to automatically measure the object represented by the model. The R source code is available on github and an R package will be available soon. A number of simplifying assumptions accelerated this initial draft.</description>
