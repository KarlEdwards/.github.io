      <description>Now letâ€™s use Schedule_Reference_Class.R in a real-world situation.
 Define a recipe
 Create a schedule
 Add a task to apply a recipe to all the video files in the in-box.
 Perform the task and view the resulting schedule.
 Perform the steps of the recipe, following along as each task finishes.
  Define a Recipe
# Define a recipe to apply to each video file the_recipe &amp;lt;- function( vid_file ) tibble::tribble( ~fun , ~args , &amp;quot;extract_images&amp;quot;, list( from_video = vid_file, to_path = paste0( DATA_PATH, &amp;#39;box2/&amp;#39; )) , &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; , list( source = &amp;#39;box2/&amp;#39;, process = &amp;#39;adjust_for_brighter_top&amp;#39;, destination = &amp;#39;box3/&amp;#39;, more_args = &amp;#39; -a k=0.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of a new machine learning project, it&#39;s a good idea to create a baseline model that functions end-to-end, even if the performance is not very good. Soon enough, you will think of ideas for better models, and want to try them, evaluate their performance, and maybe keep them for future use in a production environment. Over the lifetime of a project, data presented to the pipeline inlet are processed according to a particular recipe, which generates some useful output.</description>
