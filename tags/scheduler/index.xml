      <description>At the beginning of a new machine learning project, it&#39;s a good idea to create a baseline model that functions end-to-end, even if the performance is not very good. Soon enough, you will think of ideas for better models, and want to try them, evaluate their performance, and maybe keep them for future use in a production environment. What remains constant, over the lifetime of such a project, is that data presented to the pipeline inlet are processed according to a particular recipe, which generates some useful output.</description>
